        Each household has a garden area of over 500m2. Full electricity and
        water available. Furthermore, people have the habit of growing crops and
        raising livestock. The project aims to build small-scale crop and
        livestock farming models in residential clusters. The project will
        accompany people in the process of building and developing the model.
        Thereby, sharing scientific knowledge and gardening skills helps people
        deeply understand garden economics and build their own garden economic
        model for their families. As a result, home gardens are used effectively
        and living standards are improved. Furthermore, it contributes to a
        clean and beautiful green environment.
